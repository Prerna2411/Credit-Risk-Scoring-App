# Credit Risk Scoring App 🏦

This Streamlit web application predicts the likelihood of loan approval based on applicant financial and credit-related features. The underlying model is a **CatBoostClassifier**, trained on processed data with techniques like **EDA**, **encoding**, **SMOTE**, and evaluated using **AUC-ROC**.

## 🚀 Features

- Interactive loan approval prediction tool
- Uses top-performing **CatBoost ML model**
- Displays probability of approval
- Shows most important features influencing decision
- Clean and intuitive Streamlit-based UI

## 🧠 ML Workflow Summary

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
  Identified feature distributions, missing values, and patterns in approval status.
  
- **Data Preprocessing:**  
  - Applied **Label Encoding** and **One-Hot Encoding**  
  - Handled missing values
  - Scaled and transformed features as needed

- **Class Imbalance Handling:**  
  Used **SMOTE** (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) to balance approved/denied classes.

- **Model Selection:**  
  Best model selected using AUC-ROC and classification report was **CatBoostClassifier**.

- **Evaluation Metrics:**  
  - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score  
  - ROC-AUC Curve
